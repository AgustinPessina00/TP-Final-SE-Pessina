The Virtual Fence for Intensive Grazing Work consists of a device that allows defining a virtual fence within which the animal should be located. Additionally,
the device allows knowing and monitoring the real-time location of the animal. In case the animal is found outside the perimeter, a stimulus is sent that varies
with the distance of the animal to the fence, allowing the animal to recognize that it is outside the fence and return to it.

The work was carried out using programming languages Python and C++, and it utilized a Nucleo-FZ429ZI Board developed by ARM.

This was done within the framework of the Embedded Systems course at the Faculty of Engineering, allowing the application of different concepts acquired during
the course and the Electronic Engineering career, such as OOP, general electronics topics, protocols for data communication, among others.

The project repository includes the Work Report, which presents the planning, motivation, and technical information about the hardware and firmware,
as well as an explanation of the design and development carried out.
